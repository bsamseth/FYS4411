\chapter{Verification}
\label{chp:verfication}

This chapter is dedicated to presenting some of the tests that we have done to
verify that the software we have developed is indeed functioning as advertised.

\section{Setup}

We focus our tests on the idealized harmonic oscillator system in $D = 3$ dimensions
with $N$ non-interacting particles, i.e.\ the Hamiltonian given by
\cref{eq:ho-no-interaction-hamiltonian}:

\begin{align}
    \hat H_0 &= \sum_{i=1}^N\qty(-\frac{1}{2}\laplacian_i +
    \frac{1}{2}r_i^2),
\end{align}
where we have $\hbar = m = \omega = 1$, and
$r_i^2 = x_i^2 + y_i^2+z_i^2$. This has the ground state given by
\cref{eq:Phi-non-inter}, generalized to $N$ particles in three dimension and
omitting normalization constants:

\begin{align}
        \Phi(\mat X) &= \exp[-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^N r_i^2],
\end{align}
where as before we have defined $\mat X$ as

\begin{align}
  \mat X &\defeq \mqty(\vx_1\\\vx_2\\\vdots\\\vx_N) \defeq \mqty(x_1&y_1&z_1\\x_2&y_2&z_2\\\vdots&\vdots&\vdots\\x_N&y_N&z_N)
\end{align}

For the trail wave function we shall use two different ones. First, the simple
Gaussian form of the ground state it self:

\begin{align}
  \psi_G(\mat X) = \exp(-\alpha\sum_{i = 1}^N r_i^2),
\end{align}
with $\alpha$ the only variational parameter. Learning the ideal parameters
should be trivial in this case, and we should expect perfect results.

Second, we use an ansatz resulting from a Gaussian-Binary Restricted Boltzmann
Machine (RBM), given in \cref{eq:rbm-def}:


\begin{align}
  \psi_{RBM}(\vX) &=
        \exp[-\sum_i^{M} \frac{\qty(X_i-a_i)^2}{2\sigma^2}]
        \prod_j^H \qty(1 + \exp[b_j+\sum_i^M \frac{X_iW_{ij}}{\sigma^2}]),
\end{align}
where $M = P\cdot D$ is the number of degrees of freedom and $H$ is
the number of hidden nodes (set to 4 through this section). Note also that $X_i$
in the above refers to the $i$'th degree of freedom, counting through $\mat X$
in row major order. The variational parameters are $\vb a, \vb b$ and $\mat W$,
and we hold $\sigma^2=1$ constant in this case.

We use this wave function simply to make learning the true ground state slightly
more challenging than proposing a simple Gaussian straight away. Note that
setting $\vb{a}, \vb b$ and $\mat W$ all to zero yields the correct ground state in this particular case.


\section{Optimization}

\subsection{Integration Test}
The simplest complete test is to initialize $\psi_G$ with a non-optimal
parameter, e.g.\ $\alpha=0.3$, and attempt to learn the optimal value.
Optimizing this is trivially accomplished, and
\cref{fig:verify-gaussian-simplest} shows a training progression using $N=10$
particles. The hyperparameters have here been artificially tuned to avoid
immediate convergence to $\alpha =0.5$ so as to better illustrate
the process.

If we allow the training to progress a little further (or use more optimal
hyperparameters), it eventually finds
$\alpha = 0.5$ to within machine precision and we get
$\flatfrac{\expval{E_L}}{N} = \flatfrac{D}{2}$ with exactly zero variance. While
this test is not the most challenging, it is nevertheless a useful check.

    Hyperparameters have been tuned so that we can see what happens, as opposed
    to immediate convergence to the perfect result.}

\subsection{Learning Rate Dependency}

Successful training is highly dependent on using the correct hyperparameters.
Among the most important are the ones controlling the optimization schemes.
