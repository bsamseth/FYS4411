\chapter{Liquid $^4$He}
\label{chp:liquid-helium}

We turn now to the much more challenging system of liquid Helium, presented
in~\cref{sec:liquid-helium-theory}. As before, we will first present the
benchmark result followed by the neural networks.


\section{Benchmark}

We will use one of the simpler benchmark wave functions for this system, known
as the McMillan form wave function~\cite{McMillan-1965}:

\begin{align}
  \label{eq:McMillan-wave-function-def}
  \psi_{M} &= \exp(-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i<j} \qty(\frac{\beta}{r_{ij}})^5).
\end{align}
An important observation now is the lack of any single particle wave
function factor. In the case of the Quantum Dot we had a Gaussian localized at
the origin as a result of the potential well. This system, however, is infinite
and periodic without any such influence driving it towards particular points in
space. Furthermore, because of the lack of an external field the single particle
solutions are just free particles, and does not help us understand the many-body
system.

\subsection{Finite Size Dependency}

An important aspect of all the results that we will present is that they are
highly dependent on the number of particles used in the simulation box, as well
as the size of the box it self. We will hold the number density of particles
constant, $\rho$, and set the side lengths of the simulation box, $L$, depending on
the number of particles $N$:

\begin{align}
  L = \sqrt[3]{\frac{N}{\rho}}.
\end{align}

\noindent As the assumption of periodicity is a simplifying approximation, we
introduce some erroneous effects because of it. These generally disappear as we
increase the number of particles (and hence the size of box), but the
computation time needed to run the simulations increase significantly with
increasing numbers. The purpose of the following analysis is to test the
\emph{relative} accuracy of different wave functions. With that in mind we have
used a small number of particles in the main results, where the absolute error
introduced is significant. The number should hopefully still be large enough to
introduce all the relevant effects and produce valid test results.


\subsection{Optimizing}

We have optimized~\cref{eq:McMillan-wave-function-def} using $\num{5000}$
iterations of $\num{1000}$ MC cycles each. We used standard Metropolis sampling
along with the ADAM optimizer. \cref{fig:He-benchmark-training} shows the
progression of both the energy and variational parameter during training.
Because of the strong correlations involved, there is significantly more
variance in these results compared to the benchmark used for Quantum Dots. We
see the value for $\beta$ oscillating without any indication of converging to a
fixed value.

\cref{tab:He-benchmark-results} show the energy estimates from the final model.
The same wave function (i.e. same value for $\beta$) has also been used on
different number of particles to illustrate how the energy increases for larger
systems. Based on computations with larger and larger systems, the value for $N
= 256$ is quite close to the apparent convergence for $N\to\infty$.
