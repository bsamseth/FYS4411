\chapter{Liquid $^4$He}
\label{chp:liquid-helium}

We turn now to the much more challenging system of liquid Helium, presented
in~\cref{sec:liquid-helium-theory}. As before, we will first present the
benchmark result followed by the neural networks.


\section{Benchmark}

We will use one of the simpler benchmark wave functions for this system, known
as the McMillan form wave function~\cite{McMillan-1965}:

\begin{align}
  \label{eq:McMillan-wave-function-def}
  \psi_{M} &= \exp(-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i<j} \qty(\frac{\beta}{r_{ij}})^5).
\end{align}
An important observation now is the lack of any single particle wave function
factor. In the case of the Quantum Dot we had a Gaussian localized at the origin
as a result of the potential well. In this case, the system is periodic and as
such it would not make sense to include a localized factor. Furthermore, because
of the lack of an external field the single particle solutions are just free
particles, and does not help us understand the many-body system.
