\chapter{QFLOW: Software Package for VMC with Neural Networks}
\label{chp:qflow}

Everything discussed so far has culminated into the development of a self
contained package available to the public under the permissive MIT license. All
original results presented in the next part are produced with this package, and
the source code to reproduce them are also presented in all cases.

This chapter is dedicated to the presentation of the package, explanations of
design decisions and comparison with other tools. A more complete technical
documentation is published online~\cite{qflow}, and it is recommended to consult this
resource for practical usage.

\section{Installation}

Refer to~\cite{qflow} for up to date instructions. Here we only mention the
required components for using QFLOW:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Python 3.7 or greater
  \item A C++17 compliant compiler
  \item OpenMPI 3.1.3 or greater (or equivalent MPI implementations)
\end{itemize}
Every other dependency should be automatically resolved during installation.

\section{Quickstart}

The following example aims to showcase the basic usage pattern of QFLOW.

Say we want run a VMC optimization of two electrons in two
dimensions confined in a harmonic oscillator trap, i.e. the quantum dot system
described in \cref{sec:quantum-dots-theory}. The following complete code runs an
optimization using a Pade-Jastrow wave function and evaluates the result. All in
a few readable lines of Python:\\

\noindent The script can be run under MPI (\texttt{mpiexec -n X python script.py}) with any number of processes, which
results in almost completely linear speedup.

\section{Structure}

The package has been structured around four basic building blocks of a VMC
calculation, each of which is represented by a base class:

\begin{itemize}
\item Hamiltonians
\item Wave functions
\item Samplers
\item Optimizers
\end{itemize}

Due to this object oriented design approach, each part needs only consider how
to interact with the base classes of the other three, as opposed to duplicating
code per combination. As well as aiding development, this makes it easy the
prototype various combinations of wave functions, sampling strategies etc., as
well as trivial to exchange the Hamiltonian in question.


\subsection{Hamiltonians}

The \texttt{qflow.\-hamiltonians.\-Hamiltonian} class in QFLOW is responsible for defining the energy
(kinetic, external potentials and interaction potentials) of the system. This
class is queried for local energy evaluations/gradients as well other system
related quantities of interest. Each particular Hamiltonian is implemented as a
subclass of \texttt{qflow.\-hamiltonians.\-Hamiltonian}, and at a minimum it needs to define the
external and internal potentials (can be set equal to zero).

\subsection{Wave functions}

In a similar way, the \texttt{qflow.\-wavefunctions.\-Wavefunction} class in QFLOW defines the basic
operations required for arbitrary wave functions, and each particular trial wave
function is implemented as a subclass to this.

\subsubsection{Neural Networks}

The neural networks are used to define wave functions, and as such their
relevant definitions are structured under the \texttt{qflow.\-wavefunction} module. The
class \texttt{qflow.\-wavefunctions.\-Dnn} (Deep Neural Network) is a subclass of \texttt{qflow.\-wavefunctions.\-Wavefunction}.
Setting up the network it self is done by iteratively adding layer objects (see
later examples).

\subsection{Samplers}

Monte Carlo sampling is done through one of the implemented methods in the
\texttt{qflow.samplers} module. Again the code is structured around the base
class \texttt{qflow.samplers.Sampler}, which defines the basic interface to the
sampler, including querying for samples (system configurations) and obtaining
the acceptance rate. Specific algorithms are subclasses, such as
\texttt{qflow.\-samplers.\-MetropolisSampler} and
\texttt{qflow.\-samplers.\-ImportanceSampler}.


\subsection{Optimizers}

The last major piece is the \texttt{qflow.optimizers} module. The base class
here is \texttt{qflow.\-optimizers.\-SgdOptimzier} (Stochastic Gradient Decent),
which is the vanilla implementation from
\cref{eq:fixed-learning-rate-update-rule}. Similarly we have
\texttt{qflow.\-optimizers.\-AdamOptimizer} as a subclass of the former, which
unsurprisingly implements \cref{eq:adam-default-parameters}.


\section{Inheritance vs. Templates}

C++ has a powerful templating feature which allows us to generate code for
particular types on demand. We could have used this instead of inheritance in
order to compose Hamiltonians, wave functions etc., without the extra overhead
and bloat often associated with inheritance. While we acknowledge that a pure
template implementation would potentially give a speed increase, the inheritance
method was chosen for the following reasons:

\begin{itemize}
\item The speed increase would likely be small.
\item Compilation time would increase significantly, as unique template
  instantiations would be required for each combination
\item Selecting a different set of Hamiltonians, wave functions, samplers and
  optimizers would require another compilation run
\item A Python interface would not be possible. In order to generate the
  Python bindings we need a pre-built C++ library.
\end{itemize}
