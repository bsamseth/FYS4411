    \section{Introduction} 

    A physicist faced with a quantum many body system is quickly forced to
    abandon any hope of solving the Schrödinger equation (or one of its even worse
    relativistic siblings) exactly. Instead he must resort to one of two general
    workarounds: 1) make simplifying assumptions until the equation is solvable,
    or 2) make an educated guess for the solution. In either case, the desired
    quantity which solving the Schrödinger equation would yield is the quantum
    mechanical wavefunction. If we want to stay away from potentially faulty, or
    limiting assumptions, we must therefore somehow produce a guess for this
    wavefunction, without actually solving the equation.

    The last project utilized the Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) approach, in which a
    specific, parametrized form is assumed for the wavefunction, with the
    subsequent optimization of the parameters.

    The main limitation of VMC is that a specific form for the wavefunction is
    assumed. If this form contains the true optimum that works fine, but if not
    we are inherently limited in how accurate the final results can be.

    Aiming to be overcome this issue, we may observe that the task at hand falls
    into the general field of function approximation. We wish to approximate the
    function that takes as input the configuration of the system, and outputs a
    probability amplitude for the given state. Function approximation is a task
    which lends itself to techniques from machine learning (ML). 

    In this project we will attempt to represent the wavefunction with a
    specific type of ML-model, the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). The use
    of RBMs for such applications was presented recently by
    \textcite{Carleo602}, with encouraging results. We shall therefore attempt
    to apply the same techniques to a different type of system, namely that of
    two interacting quantum particles confined in a harmonic oscillator trap.


    \section{Theory}

    \subsection{The System}

    We consider a system of electrons confined in a pure two-dimensional
    isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, with an idealized total Hamiltonian
    given by:

    \begin{align}
        \begin{split}
            \hat H &= \sum_{i=1}^P\qty(-\frac{1}{2}\laplacian_i + V_{ext}(\vec r_i)) +
            \sum_{i < j} V_{int}(\vec r_i, \vec r_j)\\
            &= \sum_{i=1}^P\qty(-\frac{1}{2}\laplacian_i + \frac{1}{2}\omega^2
            r_i^2) + \sum_{i < j} \frac{1}{r_{ij}},
        \end{split}\label{eq:H-def}
    \end{align}
    where natural units ($\hbar=c=m_e=1$) are used with energies in
    atomic units (a.u.), $P$ denotes the number of particles in the system, and
    $\omega$ is the oscillator frequency of the trap. Further, $\vec r_i$
    denotes the position vector of particle $i$, with $r_i \equiv \norm{\vec r}$ and
    $r_{ij}\equiv \norm{\vec r_i - \vec r_j}$ defined for notational brevity.

    In this project we limit ourselves to the case of $N=2$ interacting
    electrons in a trap with a frequency such that $\hbar \omega = 1$. We do
    this because for this case we have exact, analytical solutions for the
    ground state energy. With the interaction term included, the ground state
    energy is $E_0 = \SI{3}{\au}$~\cite{Taut1993}. This limitation is purely one
    of convenience, as having exact benchmarks makes for better verification of
    results. The methods discussed in the project should extend to other
    systems.

    \subsection{Simple Non-Interacting Case}
    If we omit the interacting terms in \autoref{eq:H-def} we have
    the standard harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian:
    \begin{align}
        \hat H_0 &= \sum_{i=1}^P\qty(-\frac{1}{2}\laplacian_i +
        \frac{1}{2}\omega^2 r_i^2).
    \end{align}
    This Hamiltonian lends it self to analytical solutions, and the stationary
    states are:
    \begin{align}
        \phi_{n_x, n_y}(x, y) &= A H_{n_x}(\sqrt\omega x)H_{n_y}(\sqrt\omega y)
        e^{-\frac{\omega}{2}\qty(x^2 + y^2)},
    \end{align} 
    for quantum numbers $n_x, n_y = 0, 1,\dots$, and the Hermite polynomials
    $H_n$. The ground state, $n_x=n_y=0$ is simply
    \begin{align}
        \phi_{00}(x,y) =
        \sqrt{\frac{\omega}{\pi}}e^{-\frac{\omega}{2}\qty(x^2+y^2)}.
    \end{align}
    Using this wavefunction we can calculate the ground state
    energy\footnote{\label{fnt:sympy}See \texttt{projects/python/Sympy.ipynb} in the Github
    reposirepository for an explicit calculation of the ground state energy},
    \begin{align}
        \epsilon_{00} = \frac{\expval{\hat H_0}{\phi_{00}}}{\braket{\phi_{00}}}
        = \omega = \SI{1}{\au}
    \end{align}

    The ground state wavefunction for the (unperturbed) two-electron case is simply the
    product of the one-electron wavefunctions,
    \begin{align}
        \begin{split}
            \Phi(\vec r_1, \vec r_2) &= \phi_{00}(\vec r_1)\phi_{00}(\vec r_2)\\
            &= \frac{\omega}{\pi} e^{-\frac{\omega}{2}\qty(r_1^2+r_2^2)}.
        \end{split}\label{eq:Phi-non-inter}
    \end{align}

    The ground state energy can once again be evaluated
    analytically\cref{fnt:sympy} and yields
    \begin{align}
        E_0 = \frac{\expval{\hat H_0}{\Phi}}{\braket{\Phi}}
        = 2\omega =\SI{2}{\au}
    \end{align}
    This result is not surprising, as adding one more particle, without any
    interactions, should simply double the energy. Another way to look at it is
    that the simple harmonic oscillator solution gives $\flatfrac{\omega}{2}$
    per degree of freedom, so adding another two yields and extra $\omega$.


    When the two particles are electrons, we may say something about their total
    spin. As electrons are fermions, their total wavefunction must be
    anti-symmetric upon interchanging the labels $1$ and $2$.
    \autoref{eq:Phi-non-inter} is obviously symmetric, and so the
    spin-wavefunction must necessarily be anti-symmetric. For the combination of
    two spin-1/2 particles, there is only one candidate, namely the spin-0
    singlet:

    \begin{align}
        \chi_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\qty(\ket{\uparrow\downarrow} -
        \ket{\downarrow\uparrow}).
    \end{align}
